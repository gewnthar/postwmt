# This file makes the 'tests' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty.

# You can optionally add a test suite here for convenience,
# or define a common base class for your tests if needed.

# Example of how you might define a test loader if you want to run all tests
# from this package easily (though 'python -m unittest discover' is standard):
#
# import unittest
#
# def suite():
#     return unittest.TestLoader().discover("tests", pattern="test_*.py")
#
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
#     runner.run(suite())
